10 January 2017: Project “WHIF” (“Wireless Human InterFace”)

Can you think of a new Use Case for this Interface?
The device consists of a small PC board with a WiFi module on it and firmware that makes it simple to add a wireless browser interface to an arduino, PIC, or any other electronics project being put together. The device also makes it simple to use assets in the browser host being used, such as the GPS, compass and accelerometer in a smartphone. It can use the host to send and retrieve information (emails, text messages, etc.) to & from the cloud.

Our secret after-meeting meeting place has been discovered

souther-triangle_orig1From the news:

SAN DIEGO (CNS) – A San Diego-based craft brewer won a $35,000 prize today that will help pay for international expansion efforts.

Rough Draft earned the grand prize in the second annual MetroConnect competition, organized by World Trade Center San Diego. The family-owned brewery is known for its India pale ales and operates a Miramar-area tasting room.

Rough Draft was one of five finalists in the competition, part of a larger effort to encourage San Diego companies to expand their global reach.

Eagle information provided by J.R. Marshall

eagle-7-7-net-and-pin-names

Latest Information

I went ahead and updated this afternoon since I’ll be at the talk tomorrow.  Then after dinner I was clicking out a simple breakout board from a QFN-20 to DIP-0.3, and was surprised to see pin numbers on pins, then net names on traces.  Also I was surprised that Cadsoft fixed the flip board ULP to make it work rather well even in the Standard version.  For us Eagle users this seems like the start of some great improvements, finally!

I thought you guys would appreciate the news, and you are welcome to use the screen shot on the website, or even in a news slide prior to brining up the presenter.

sparkfun successful design iteration

https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1570

I want to submit this as an example of a successful community based iteration of a design problem.  Chris Taylor of SparkFun identified a product that merits improvement, built and tested a prototype and then documented and published his results, and the community commented and added many, many useful suggestions!

I have a project I’ve been working on for a couple of weeks, and I might release it open source hardware and set up a page under SDHH to document it and solicit community feedback.  It’s a sub-project of TrioChip, but also can stand on its own.  It’s a very small connector for In Circuit Programming and Serial Debugging. The footprint on the PCB is a 0.250″ diameter circle. I have PCBs designed in EAGLE and ordered from OSH park, and pogo pins and hardware ordered via eBay and coming from China.  In a few weeks when the parts arrive I’ll test it, and if it seems promising I’ll start documenting it!  The magic of it is it’s very small, can be used temporally by holding it to the board for a quick program, or easily securely connected for long term reprogram and serial debugging.  The most similar commercial product is the Tag Connect, but it’s too large and expensive for my use.

Arduino Dispute Settled

It was announced on October 1, 2016 at the New York City Maker Faire that the lawsuit between the two feuding Arduino companies is being settled.

The notice is on several Web sites. The American company Arduino LLC www.arduino.cc posted as follows: https://blog.arduino.cc/2016/10/01/two-arduinos-become-one-2/#more-15167

This was simultaneously announced by the Italian company Arduino SRL www.arduino.org in the following posting: http://www.arduino.org/blog/two-arduinos-become-one

A reporter from Hackaday.com gives the following summary: http://hackaday.com/2016/10/01/arduino-vs-arduino-arduino-won/

The historic details of the lawsuit can be found at: https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/mad/167131/

The general outline of the settlement is that at the end of 2016, worldwide wholesale distribution of the hardware will be handled by a newly created “Arduino Holding” company.

There will also be an “Arduino Foundation” responsible for the open source Arduino desktop IDE, the community, and other initiatives.

Further details of the settlement were not announced, and the disposition of the tradename “Genuino” was not announced.

There is a discussion forum on this topic for the San Diego Hardware Hackers at: /hackers/forums/topic/arduino-on-arduino-battle-ends-in-reconciliation-merger/
